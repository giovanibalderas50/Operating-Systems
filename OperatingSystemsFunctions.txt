One function of the operating system is to boot the computer. Also known as starting a computer. It checks the computer and makes sure it is ready to work.
Another function of the operating sysetm is to control all devices attached to the computer. The hardware devices are controlled with the help of small software called device drivers.which is pretty cool if you ask me.
